and much more...

- **Data source**: [Cisco UCS Manager (UCSM)](https://www.cisco.com/c/en/us/products/servers-unified-computing/ucs-manager/index.html), read-only account is enough
- **Data receiver**: [Telegraf](https://github.com/influxdata/telegraf)
- **Data storage**: [InfluxDB](https://github.com/influxdata/influxdb), a time-series database
- **Visualization**: [Grafana](https://github.com/grafana/grafana)

## Installation (without Basic UTM)
- Tested OS: CentOS 7.x. Should work on other OS also.
- Python version: Version 3 only. Should be able to work on Python 2 also with minor modification.

Two options (ONLY OVA INSTALLATION HAS BEEN VALIDATED FOR THE POWER CONSUMPTION):
- DIY Installation: Self install the required packages (or take a look to [ansible-install](ansible-install) folder where you could let the machine work for you)
- OVA - Required packages are pre-installed on CentOS 7.6 OVA

## Installation (With existing UTM)

-Replace the existing python script (/usr/local/telegraf/ucs_traffic_monitor.py) with the updated version from this directory (telegraf/ucs_traffic_monitor.py)
-Import the dashboard files (json files in grafana/dashboard) into your grafana (using the UI, Dashboard --> Manage --> import --> import json file, select override options)

### OVA installation (Preferred)
1.Download and deploy the OVA:
[Download OVA Here](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1FDshn1QMOlQl4Gd3VhKwFuM67ZiA6PJC/view).
[UTM ova releases page](https://github.com/paregupt/ucs_traffic_monitor/releases).

2. Clone the git repository:
git clone https://github.com/jlefeuvr/ucs_traffic_monitor

3. Launch the upgrade script:
upgrade_utm.sh

4. check ntp sync (need to update /etc/chrony.conf with 'server <your_ntp_server_ip_address>'

This is a CentOS 7.6 based OVA. Deployment is same as any other OVA that you have deployed before. [Click here for detailed installation instructions of the UTM OVA](https://www.since2k7.com/blog/2020/02/29/cisco-ucs-monitoring-using-grafana-influxdb-telegraf-utm-installation/#Installing_UTM_using_OVA). The OVA is based on v0.3. Upgrading to the latest must be your first step.

### DIY Installation
1. Install Telegraf
1. Install InfluxDB
1. Install Grafana. Install following plugins:
    1. Flowchart
    1. Pie Chart (using Pie chart v2 starting UTM v0.6)
    1. ePict panel (Not needed starting UTM v0.6)
    1. multistat (Not needed starting UTM v0.6)
1. Install following Python modules
    1. Cisco UCSM Python SDK
    1. netmiko library
    


## Upgrades
You are responsible to upgrade Grafana, InfluxDB, Telegraf, Python and other packages. Upgrading UTM is simple with one or two commands and doesn't take more than a few minutes. Please refer to respective packages for upgrade process. Please keep a watch on the security vulnerabilities and fixes.

## Configuration

[ucs_traffic_monitor.py](https://github.com/paregupt/ucs_traffic_monitor/blob/master/telegraf/ucs_traffic_monitor.py "ucs_traffic_monitor.py") fetches metrics from Cisco UCS and stitches them. This file is invoked by telegraf exec input plugin every 60 seconds. Login credentials of UCS should be available in ucs_domains_group*.txt.

Try 
```shell
$ python3 /usr/local/telegraf/ucs_traffic_monitor.py -h
```
if you are running this for the first time.

Change/Add to your telegraf.conf file as below

```shell
[[inputs.exec]]
   interval = "60s"
   commands = [
       "python3 /usr/local/telegraf/ucs_traffic_monitor.py /usr/local/telegraf/ucs_domains.txt influxdb-lp -vv",
   ]
   timeout = "50s"
   data_format = "influx"
```

also update the global values like

```shell
  logfile = "/var/log/telegraf/telegraf.log"
  logfile_rotation_max_size = "10MB"
  logfile_rotation_max_archives = 5
```
This should be able to 

 1. Pull metrics from UCS every 60 seconds
 2. Stitch them end-to-end between FI uplink ports and vNIC/vHBA on blade servers
 3. Write the data to InfluxDB

Import the [dashboards](https://github.com/paregupt/ucs_traffic_monitor/tree/master/grafana/dashboards) into Grafana. That's all. UTM should be fully functional.
